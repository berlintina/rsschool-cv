Making Websites was always for me as a funny game. Creatives customers, interesting designs, very fast CMS composition and "Voila" everybody are happy. It is time to increase my humble knowledge, its time to grow up and to go further and to know what ist "industrial speed". I want to be a part of a large community and to be a team player.

I have studied in BSUIR and became a "system Ingenier" Diplom. During this time I started to work with PHP, Html, CSS, Flash.
Sins 2013 till 2019 I was working in Quadriga-Media Berlin, and did websites for Political and Communications events. Also, I'm still serving for small artists and startups and prepare for them  Web Identity.
 
I have some other passion. I love fashion and design, I organize a projects for fashion editorial, and try to populate science with the help of fashion.

As much as possible, I try to improve my knowledge in HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, and Also Sketch, Photoshop 

My working language is English, German and Russian. I also can speek a little bit of Spanish and Japanese.
