        Making Websites was always for me as a funny game. Creatives customers, interesting designs, very fast CMS composition and "Voila" everybody are happy. It is time to increase my humble knowledge, its time to grow up and to go further and to know what ist "industrial speed". I want to be a part of a large community and to be a team player.
